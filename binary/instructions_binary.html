<h5><u>Your task</u></h5>
<p>
    In this part, you will be asked to choose between two workers.
</p>
<p>
    You will make 9 decisions.
    In each decision, you have to choose between two workers.
    For each worker, you will see information about: A) whether they performed in the top 4, middle 4 or bottom 4
    within their set from 1-{{ C.number_of_workers_sep }} and B) their gender (shown by an avatar).

    EXPLAIN AVATARS

<h5><u>Your bonus payment</u></h5>
<p>
    If this part will be drawn as the part-that-counts, one of your decisions will also be randomly drawn as the <b>decision-that-counts</b>.
    Your bonus payment is determined by the performance of the worker that your hired in the decision-that-counts.
    For each point that your assigned worker has, you receive {{ C.conversionrate }}.
    Example: If that worker who you hired in the decision-that-counts got a productivity score of {{ C.examplescore }},
    you will receive a bonus payment of {{ C.examplebonus}}.
</p>
