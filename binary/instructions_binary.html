<p><i>Please read the following explanations carefully!!</i></p>

<h5><u>Your task</u></h5>
<p>
    In this part, you will repeatedly be asked to choose between two of the workers from our previous study.
</p>
<p>
    You will make 9 decisions.
    For each worker, you will see information about: <br>
    A) whether they performed in the top 4, middle 4 or bottom 4 within their subgroup (female or male) <br>
    B) their gender.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    <img class="avatarimg_small" src="{% static "global/avatar_f.png" %}" /> refers to an  female worker.
    <img class="avatarimg_small" src="{% static "global/avatar_m.png" %}" /> refers to a male worker.
</p>
-->
<br />

<h5><u>Your bonus payment</u></h5>
<p>
    If this part will be drawn as the part-that-counts, one of your decisions will also be randomly drawn as the <b>decision-that-counts</b>.
    Your bonus payment is determined by the performance of the worker that your hired in the decision-that-counts.
    For each point that your assigned worker has, you receive {{ C.conversionrate }}.
    Example: If that worker who you hired in the decision-that-counts got a productivity score of {{ C.examplescore }},
    you will receive a bonus payment of {{ C.examplebonus}}.
</p>


<br />

<h5><u>Data</u></h5>
    <i>
    Remember: All data that you enter in this survey will be treated anonymously and will solely be used for academic research.
    Neither the experimenter nor anyone else will be able to identify you from the answers that you give in this survey.
